randomized color coding algorithms for estimating graph motif counts

1. Introduction
    - Graphlets, motifs: inuced subgraphs
    - approximate counting
    - **goal: size가 5~6인 motif도 counting하는 practical algorithm 개발**
    - ongoing research (sampling)
        - random walk - inefficient
        - CC algorithm - use color coding technique
            1. build an abstract “urn(바구니)” which conatins a sub population of all the k-trees of G
            2. task of sampling k-graphlets -(reduced)→ sampling k-trees from the urn
            
            ⇒ Therefore, 1. build-up phase, 2. sampling phase.
            
        
        → CC algorithm outperforms random walk
        
    - What problems CC have?
        1. time and space limit
        2. taking s samples gives additive 1/s- approximation ⇒ 1/s 이상의 fraction을 가진 motif만 count 가능
    - contributions of the paper
        1.  따라서 이 논문에서는 color coding 기법을 사용하여 단점을 극복하고자 함. How?
            1. **하나의 machine word로 up to 16개의 node를 가진 colored rooted trees를 표현하는 simple color coding data structure을 소개하고자 함 (build phase)**
            2. **large graph에서는, biased coloring trick을 제시하고자 함 (space-time trade-off)**
            3. describe set of architectural and implementation optimizations
        2. for the sampling phase
            - 가장 frequent한 motif를 estimate하고, urn에서 제거. 이를 반복
            - small relative error가 있을 수 있음
            
            ⇒ AGS: adative graphlet sampling 알고리즘 제시
            
    - **result of the work: MOTIVO**
        - scalable, takes little time

1. Color coding and CC
    - detect paths and trees
    - consists of a build-up phases and a sampling phase
    

2.1 The build-up phase

- **goal: build a treelet count table (abstract urn, used for sampling)**
- steps
    1. do coloring of G
    2. look at treelets of G that are colorful (non-induced copies)
    3. for each v, initialize $c(T_c, v)=1$, where T is the trivial treelet on 1 node and $C=\set{c_v}$. 
    4. count $c(T_C, v)$ via dynamic programming
        - Theorem 1.1: build-up takes time $O(a^k m)$ and space $O(a^kn)$.

2.2 The sampling phase

- goal: sample colorful graphlet copies using treelet count table from the build-up phase
- multi-stage
    1. draw a node and $T_C$.
    2. decompose $T_C$ and recursively sample a copy of $T_{C'}'$ and so on.
    3. combine
    
    ⇒ This gives a colorful copy of T drawn uniformly at random from G
    
    - Using $E[x_i]=c_i\sigma_i/t$ where $\sigma_i$: number of spanning trees in $H_i$, t: total number of colorful k-treelets (both can be computed quickly), let $\hat{c_i}=t\sigma_i^{-1}x_i$. (unbiased)
- How to estimate **the number of total (uncolored) copies** $g_i$ of $H_i$?
    
    ⇒ $p_k$=possibility that a fixed subset of k nodes in G becomes colorful
    
    ⇒ $E[c_i]=p_kg_i$, so that $\hat{g_i}=c_i/p_k$. (unbiased)
    
1. Speeding up color coding
    - data structures
    

3.1 Succint data structures

- a hash table maps the pointer of each $T_C$ to the count $c(T_C, v)$.
- The internals of CC
    - check-and-merge step: for every u~v, counts c(T’, v) and c(T’’, u) in the hash tables of v and u, check their intersection is emty, and merge
        
        → takes 30%~70% of build-up phase
        
- Motivo’s treelet
    - encode T → binary string $s_T$
        - perform DFS starting from r and i-th bit becomes 0 or 1
        - merging T: concantenating 1, $s_{T''}$, $s_{T'}$.
    - so we can get followings easily:
        - getsize()
        - merge(T’, T’’)
        - decomp(T)
        - sub(T)
