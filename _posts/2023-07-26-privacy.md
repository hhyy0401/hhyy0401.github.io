[Abstract]

- generating privacy-preserving graph data
- transmitting privacy-preserved information

[1. Introduction]

focus on

1. privacy-preserving graph data
    - how can we protect (mask, hide, perturb) sensitive information from node identify disclosure and link re-identification?

[2.1 Privacy Attackers on Graphs]

- aim of attackers: (1) whether edges exist (2) reveal true identities of targeted users

2.1.1. Category of Attackers

- active attackers
    - k 노드를 가지는 subgraph H를 만들어서 G에 넣은다음 s.t. $\abs{H\cap G}=b$, 나중에 G’로 published 됐을 때 G’ 안의 H를 찾고 b 개의 노드를 판명한다.
    - original graph에 published 되기 전에 접근함
- passive attackers
    - creation 대신 observation에 의존함
    - “node A는 degree가 2 이상”와 같은 external information 이용

2.1.2. Goal of Attackers

- diclosure of node identity: where is node A?
- link re-identification: determine private edges (not published) containing such as disease records
    - besides existence, we can infer weight or type of links
    

[2.2 Background Knowledge for Passive Attacks]

2.2.1 Background Knowledge for Node Identity Disclosure

- it helps them to detect “uniqueness” of victims
- target node의 background knowledge H를 알면, candidates를 줄일 수 있다
- method
    - vertex refinement queries
        - H0(x): node x의 label
        - H1(x): node x의 degree
        - Hi(x): multiset of Hi-1(x) queries on 1-hop neighbors of node x
        
        ![Untitled](/assets/img/privacy//Untitled%203.png)
        
    - subgraph queries
        - existence of a subgraph
        - more general, flexible
        - note that different searching strategies can result in different subgraph structures
    - hub finger print queries
        - hub: node of a high degree and a high betweeness centrality
        - hub fingerprint: node’s connection to hubs
    - neighborhood relationship queries
        - rely on isomorphism of the ego-graph

2.2.2. Background Knowledge for Link Re-Identification]

- Method
    - link prediction probablistic model
        - 다른 종류의 background information이 probabilistic model을 만드는데 leverage 될 수 있다 (e.g node attributes, existing relationships, structural properties, inferred relationships)
            - mathematically, the existence of a sentsitive relation of node i and node j as: $P(e_{ij}^s;O)$ where $e^s_{ij}$: sensitive relationship, O: a set of observations
    - Randomization-based Posterior Probability
        
        ![Untitled](/assets/img/privacy//Untitled%204.png)
        
        - attacker applies randomization mechanism on G’ N times to get a sequence of G’s, and utilize that information

[2.3. Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms]

2.3.1. Protection Mechanism Designed for Node Identity Disclosure

- k-degree anonymization
    - target node x는 적어도 k-1의 node와 같은 degree를 share한다
    - degree distribution d → new distribution d’ (instanced by L1 distance)
    - construct G’ following d’
    
    *Towards identity anonymization on graphs (KDD’08)*
    
- k-degree anonymization in temporal graphs
    - ensure temporal degree sequence of each node is indistinguishable from that of at least k-1 other nodes
    - degree matrix D → D’
- k-degree anonymization in knowledge graphs
    - k-anonymity of the same attributes and degree
    - node feature와 degree에 따라 node를 clusters로 partition
- k-neighborhood anonymization
    - when an attacker knows background knowledge about neighborhood relationships
    - k-anonymity of neighborhood structure
    - use DFS search → vector → greedily make N(v) and N(u) same → construct G’
- k-automorphism anonymization
    - prevent from subgraph queries
    - G and G’ is k-automorphic
        - at least k-different matches in G’ for a subgraph query
    - KM algorithm

2.3.2 Protection Mechanism Designed for Link Re-Identification

- Intact Edges
    - remove all s type edges
- Partial-edge removal
    - remove part of sensitive edges
        - criteria: whether their existence contributes to the exposure of sensitive links
- Cluster-edge anonymization
    - partition G into clusters
    - remove edges inintra-clusters
    - preserve inter-cluster
    - can be interpreted as k-degree anonymization
- Cluster-edge anonymization with constraints
    - advanced version of above

2.3.3. General Privacy Protection Mechanisms

- Graph Summarization
- Switching-based Graph Generation
    - configuration model
    - preserve degree distribution
    - largely preserve original graph features (eigenvalues of adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix)
- Spectral Add/Del and Spectral Switch
    - repeats adding and deleting edges
    - random switch
    - overall degree distribution not change
    - develop method that preserves largest aigenvalue of A and second smallest eigenvalue of L=D-A
- RandomWalk-Mod
    - copy each edge in G to G’ while guaranteeing the degree distribution of G’ is unchanged
    

**Differential Privacy**

M: permutation

- It also categorizes to edge-level and node-level differential privacy

[2.4. Other Aspects of Graph Anonymization]

- 기존
    - 익명화 그래프 G’를 published 하는 대신, some non-trivial statistics를 랜덤화하고 이것을 relase하고 있음
    - 중요한 graph parameter를 보존하고 있음 (e.g. eigenvalue)

[2.5. Challenges and Future Opportunities]

2.5.1 preserving privacy for temporal graphs

- 기존 연구는 static graph를 주로 다루지만, 실생활 그래프는 거의 evolve함

2.5.2 preserving privacy for heterogeneous graphs

- 대부분 background knowledge는 structural queries를 사용
- node와 edge feature이 많은 경우, leaking sensitive information의 위험성을 증가시킴

⇒ 어떤 feature information이 heterogeneous와 time-eovolving graphs에서 중요할 것이고, 숨겨져야 하느냐

⇒ 이걸 위한 method는?
